I was in elementary school when I wrote this code, so please don't judge too hard.

The project summary isn't really adequate to explain the motivation behind this project. As a Chrome user, 
I was getting a bit annoyed at the number of issues marked as WontFix on the Chromium project page. So
I wanted to make an extension that would implement some of those features, and some other cool things.
The only one that I ended up implementing was a custom new tab page. Another one that I remember was 
a right-click option to set an image as the wallpaper, though I remember Mohamed Mansour
[implemented that](https://github.com/mohamedmansour/set-wallpaper-extension) for Windows.

Here's the project summary from the Google Code page:

OptionsPlus is a Google Chrome Extension that offers more ways to customize Google Chrome. Are you tired of 
having your ideas WontFix'd by Chrome? This extension does, or will, implement many of those features.
